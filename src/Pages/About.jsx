            About Us
          </h1>
          <p className="text-xl">
            At Food Share Community, our journey began with a simple yet
            profound idea: to bridge the gap between abundance and scarcity. We
            are a passionate and driven group of individuals who believe in the
            power of sharing and caring. Our mission is clear - to ensure that
            no one in our community goes to bed hungry.

            What Drives Us
          </h1>
          <p className="text-xl">
            We are on a mission to tackle food waste head-on. Every day,
            countless pounds of perfectly good food go to waste while there are
            people who struggle to find their next meal. This stark reality is
            what fuels our determination.

          <p className="text-xl">
            We work tirelessly to rescue surplus food and distribute it to those
            who need it the most. The heart of our community is built on

            hunger and nourish the spirits of those facing adversity.
